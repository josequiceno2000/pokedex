# üß¢ Go Pokedex REPL
Fully functional command-line Pokedex built in Go! This REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) uses the PokeAPI to fetch real-time Pok√©mon data, complete with HTTP networking, JSON decoding, and in-memory caching.

## üìù Description
This project is an interactive CLI application that lets users explore Pok√©mon data from their terminals. Currently supports fetching Pok√©mon info, listing areas, and more - all while caching responses for optimzied performance.

## üí° Motivation
The goal of the project was to use Go and APIs to make something interesting and functional. The Pokedex served as an awesome idea to put backend development skills to fun use.
